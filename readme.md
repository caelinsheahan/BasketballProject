Project proposal #1

This is going to be a really serious site. The idea here the user doesn't know which NBA player to watch, so we take some personal information and assign them a favorite player.

The idea is that the user is someone with a sense of humor, can differentiate sarcasm from reality, weighs at least 185 pounds, is at least 6'6, has a net-worth of at least a NBA minimum contract and is not Kwame Brown(just kidding Kwame).

The tech we will be using to achieve this will be JQuery, the nba API and the classic combo of html/javascript/css.
